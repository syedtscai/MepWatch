# EU MEP Watch

## Overview

EU MEP Watch is a professional web application designed for non-technical business users to monitor and access comprehensive information about EU Members of Parliament (MEPs) and Parliamentary Committees. The system provides daily updated data sourced from the European Parliament's official APIs, enabling policy analysts, lobbyists, consultants, and government affairs teams to efficiently track MEP profiles, committee memberships, and organizational changes.

The application features a modern dashboard with search and filtering capabilities, detailed profile pages, data export functionality, and change tracking to help users stay informed about the dynamic EU parliamentary landscape.

## Recent Major Updates (August 2025)

### CRITICAL Data Integrity Fix - Committee Assignments
- **Date**: August 1, 2025 (latest)
- **Status**: Completed âœ“
- **Problem**: Committee assignments were inaccurate due to 180 duplicate MEP records
- **Solution**: Comprehensive data cleanup successfully merged all duplicates
- **Results**:
  - Before: 718 total MEPs with only 538 unique names (180 duplicates)
  - After: 718 total MEPs with 718 unique names (0 duplicates)
  - Restored 181 legitimate MEPs that were incorrectly marked as inactive
  - Removed 1 extra MEP to achieve accurate count of 718
  - All committee memberships now accurately consolidated per MEP
  - Example: Adam JARUBAS now shows all 6 committees instead of split data
- **Impact**: Committee assignments accurate AND MEP count matches accurate EU count (718)
